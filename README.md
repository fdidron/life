# Conway's game of life using C++ / Raylib

A fun experiment with C++ and Raylib to simulate Conway's Game of Life. The idea is to learn game programming without spending too much time on game design / logic.

I want to approach this project as a learning experience, and learn about all the technical aspects of game development.
